                                                 HR Analytics Attrition Prediction Project
Overview:
This project analyzes employee data to predict attrition (turnover) and helps HR teams understand, visualize, and reduce resignation risks within the organization. Using Python for data analysis & machine learning, and Power BI for business dashboards, it provides actionable insights with interactive visuals.

Main Features:
Employee attrition prediction using Python machine learning models

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on department, salary band, tenure, satisfaction

Power BI dashboard showing trends, department risk, and at-risk employees

SHAP explainability for model transparency

Steps to Use:

1.Run Python scripts:

  Perform EDA and model training on hr_analytics_data.csv.

  Export summary CSVs for Power BI.

2.Open Power BI Desktop:

  Import exported summary and prediction CSV files.

  Set up table relationships (e.g., Department, AgeGroup).

  Build visuals (bar charts, scorecards, tables) for each dashboard section.

  Add titles and data labels for clarity.

3.Explore and share:

  Use filters/slicers for interactive exploration.

  Share or publish your dashboard.
